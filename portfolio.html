            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to My Portfolio!
            </p>
            <p>
            Hi, I’m Lorenzo Latinne, an aspiring software and web developer with a passion for learning and creating.
            I’m currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Programming and honing my skills in C#, JavaScript, HTML, and
            CSS. This portfolio serves as both a final project and a showcase of my growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you’ll find highlights of my work, including projects like a Mastermind game built in C# and this
                portfolio itself. Each project reflects my enthusiasm for blending logic and creativity—a hallmark of
                programming that I find deeply rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before diving into IT, I gained valuable experience as a Manager’s Assistant, where I sharpened my
                organizational and communication skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my wife and friends,
                playing guitar, and exploring the balance of discipline and creativity through music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for visiting—I’m excited to share my journey and future projects with you!
            </p>

            <h4>Why programming?</h4>
            <p class="emphasize1 bold">
                Why did I choose to study programming?
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to study programming because it opens doors to countless opportunities and empowers me to shape the digital world. It’s a highly in-demand skill with competitive salaries and the flexibility to work across industries or even start my own business. Programming sharpens my problem-solving skills and enables me to transform creative ideas into tangible solutions. I find it exciting to design and build tools that can make tasks easier or even innovate entirely new processes. The sense of accomplishment that comes from solving complex challenges and seeing my creations come to life is incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love that it’s a future-proof skill, keeping me relevant in a tech-driven world that’s constantly changing. The supportive community and wealth of accessible resources make learning both engaging and enjoyable. Programming also offers the chance to contribute to solving global challenges, whether through improving healthcare, advancing sustainability, or enhancing communication. It’s a field that encourages lifelong learning and personal growth, which inspires me to keep pushing my limits and exploring new possibilities.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasize1 bold">
                Why do I think this profession suits me?
            </p>
            <p>
                A profession in programming suits me well because I thrive on problem-solving and enjoy tackling challenges with a blend of logical thinking and creativity.

            </p>
            <p>
                The flexibility to work remotely and maintain a healthy work-life balance makes this career even more appealing, offering the freedom to excel professionally while dedicating time to personal interests and relationships. This balance is crucial for sustaining motivation and long-term success. I also find great fulfillment in building practical solutions that address real-world needs, whether it’s simplifying tasks, enhancing productivity, or creating something entirely new. Seeing the tangible impact of my work not only inspires me but also reinforces my decision to pursue programming as more than just a career—it’s a meaningful and rewarding path that aligns with my values and aspirations.

                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">1.</span> I've spent a fair amount of time, before the start of my formal education, self-learning programming. I've worked with a few data structures and logical algorithms. I also am able to apply set coding conventions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">2.</span> Since the start of this education, I've been learning how to program in C#. This is something that enables me to create more dynamic programs compared to the basic websites or console applications I used to program in the past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">3.</span> I still have a lot of time left to spent with C# to fully unlock my potential as a programmer. In addition to this I am also still left to be exposed to a whole array of frameworks and libraries that allow for more efficient code and therefore more scalable and useful projects.

                        <span class="bold">Coding and Development:</span> So far I've coded a CV website, a portfolio page and a Mastermind game. These projects required different tools and languages. I've managed to develop each project as its own entity, using code that's well-readable and adaptable when required.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Debugging and Troubleshooting:</span> As a programmer, it's unthinkable to develop software without running into certain bugs. It's a skill for a programmer to be able to identify these bugs and solve them correctly. I've encountered my fair share of bugs while developing my projects and I've learned to use the debugging and troubleshooting tools to be able to fix these issues.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Continuous Learning and Optimisation:</span> It never happens that a program of certain size is written overnight. When spending more time with a project, certain aspects are changed or rearranged. I've learned to refactor variables, methods and functions to make more sense within the program and allow for better readability. When new features are implemented, it's important that other parts of the program are adapted to allow for a better optimisation. For example, in the sprint-based project of the Mastermind game, it was important to implement these aspects.

                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">1.</span> During this formal education I've been given certain pieces of code with their own issues and errors. I was required to fix these bugs to get the program to do what it was expected to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">2.</span> I am able to detect certain bugs, some even by just looking at the code without running it yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">3.</span> It's not easy to fix a certain bug and already be aware of any other bugs this fix can cause. Sometimes I might plan in more testing moments to prevent having to test "bigger" parts of a project at once.

                        <span class="bold">Test Execution:</span> No program ever gets released without testing. Better yet, it's important to test the project frequently so issues can be handled before they snowball into much bigger ones. I've learned to test my projects, both the web project as the C# project, to dodge further pitfalls and more work down the line.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Test Planning:</span> I've created a plan within my Mastermind Project at which stages of development I wish to test my program. Implementation of bigger features required more frequent testing.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Test Design:</span> I haven't yet created test designs but in the future I'm sure I will have to. These designs are meant to simulate real world scenarios in which the program has to be able to perform.

                        <span class="bold">Encouraging Collaboration:</span> I am a social being that enjoys working with a team or within a community aspiring to reach a common goal. I also like to motivate people to reach their full potential. This I also haven't done yet, but just like the example above, I will be doing this next semester.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Effective Meeting Management:</span> In my past work experience I was required to set up meetings and have these run smoothly. It's of great importance that most, if not all, bullet points are handled and a concise report is written. This allows for a better work flow and enables every member of the team to know what's expected of them.

                        <span class="bold">Pursuing Continuous Education:</span> I love to keep learning. I apply myself to online courses for programming so I always stay up-to-date with new trends. My first introduction with programming was finishing Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science. Since then I've done FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy and TheOdinProject. I still frequently browse through sites like Pluralsight and Udemy to find interesting courses.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Practising Skills Regularly:</span> In my spare time I'm regularly coding, creating fun little projects or just honing my skills trying to reverse-engineer something someone else has created. The best way to get better in anything, is to do it consistently. That's the way I learned how to play guitar, sing, and how I learn to program.

                        <span class="bold">Task description:</span> This task was meant to teach us how Git works. How does a repository work in the cloud? How to get it to the local machine? How to work on it and update it back to the cloud? This is a day-to-day, if not hour-to-hour working routine I will be doing as an IT professional.<br> In this task, I was assigned to create a simple WPF application in which a user can click on a color, see its hex-code and the meaning of said color. The core assignment was being able to commit each feature and push it to the online repository.

                        <span class="bold">Personal challenges:</span> Because I always worked strictly locally when I was learning myself how to program, I never used Git. It's quite obvious that this is extremely important to understand and to master, since this is one of the minimal requirements any IT professional must have to be able to work in a team.

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">What I learned:</span> I learned that this is an extremely helpful tool, and one that does not necessarily only has to be used when working with a team. It's nice to be able to have your work progress saved in a cloud, so you can always pull it and work on it on any device. And if ever hardware decides to quit working, which we all know occasionally might happen, you still have all your work securely saved on GitHub or any other Git service.

                        <span class="bold">Task description:</span> The task was a reflection assignment on my experience with the Scratch project. Rather than focusing on the technical execution of the task, the aim was to reflect on my learning process and personal development. I had to analyse my strengths and weaknesses, recognise my learning style, and improve my approach for future tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Personal challenges:</span> The simplicity of the task provided little room for creative growth, which made me realise that I often learn the most from more complex tasks. I also discovered that I sometimes set high expectations for myself and put too much pressure on myself. It was a challenge to set realistic goals and be patient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">What I learned:</span> I learned the importance of self-awareness and patience in my learning process. The realisation that I need to be patient with simpler tasks and value small wins became clear. I also recognised that I need more challenges to truly grow. This reflection helped me improve my future learning strategies.

                        <span class="bold">Task description:</span> The task was to replicate a web page based on specific requirements given in the "Project Requirements" session. For each requirement, a separate commit was made in my repository, with the corresponding ID (e.g., NAV-01) included in the commit message.

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Personal challenges:</span> A challenge was understanding how to properly use Flexbox to align the list items horizontally instead of vertically, as well as centring the elements in the three containers (left, middle, right). Additionally, styling the right container to match the design (e.g., making the borders rounded for an oval shape) was a bit tricky. Using CSS properties like position and z-index to layer the navigation over the video in the header also required some experimentation.

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">What I learned:</span> I learned how to use Flexbox to align elements horizontally and how to centre items within containers using Flexbox and CSS. Additionally, I gained a better understanding of using CSS properties like border-radius to create rounded corners and position/z-index for layout control. Overall, I improved my skills in layout structuring and styling to achieve a more polished result.

                AIM-reflection on Web Project: CV.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my Web Project: CV, I’ve developed a lot of core qualities like perseverance, adaptability, and a strong willingness to learn. I faced challenges, especially around sticking to a design and adapting the website to be mobile-responsive, but I pushed through and learned a great deal in the process. One of the biggest lessons I took away is the importance of planning ahead rather than diving straight into things. Early on, I didn’t fully follow the project’s requirements, which led to me overcomplicating the design at times. However, I was able to adjust and refocus, and in the end, I’m proud of the website I created.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working solo on this project gave me complete creative freedom, which I appreciated, but it also meant I didn’t get external feedback, something I may consider in the future. While I initially struggled with the limitations of using only HTML and CSS, I ultimately learned that I could do a lot more with these tools than I thought. The process made me more confident in building static webpages, and I know I could create something similar much faster now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back, I see that I could’ve saved time by making decisions about fonts, colors, and images earlier on, instead of focusing so much on the layout first. This would’ve helped me streamline the design process. I also learned how essential it is to have a responsive design, so I focused on using media queries and flexbox containers to ensure the website was user-friendly on mobile devices. I even removed background images that weren’t fitting well on smaller screens, which was a good move for improving the experience across different devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I’m happy with my progress, and I feel much more confident in my ability to build websites. This project has taught me the value of balancing creativity with practical requirements, as well as the importance of planning ahead to save time and avoid unnecessary setbacks. Going forward, I plan to use these insights in my future projects, knowing that a well-thought-out design can make a big difference.

                What did you learn during this POP session?
            </p>
            <p>
                During this POP session, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of structured planning to effectively balance learning, work, and personal responsibilities. The detailed schedule highlighted the significance of focused study periods, such as working on "C# Essentials" and "Data Essentials," alongside time allocated for rest and everyday activities. This thoughtful structure is essential for maintaining long-term productivity and developing expertise.

                How can you implement the learning material from this session in your daily life as a programmer?
            </p>
            <p>
                In my daily life as a programmer, I can apply this approach by creating a similarly time-blocked schedule. For example, I could dedicate specific hours to learning new programming languages, revisiting foundational knowledge, and tackling coding challenges while also setting aside time for relaxation and reflection. Adopting such disciplined planning will enhance my focus and help prevent burnout, ultimately improving my learning progress and professional performance.

                I've always been passionate about technology and computers. It's with great admiration that I've looked at artistic websites and video games and I always aspired to some day be able to create my own technological pieces of art. I've started this formal education with the goal to not only learn but to grow as a developer. Not just on the technical side of things but the creative as well. Working with peers on a project and therefore a common goal is a great perspective I look forward to in my future career.

            <p>
                Growing up in a family of entrepreneurs, it's inevitable that I've grown fond of the idea of being responsible for my own company. Throughout the years, it's not so much the need to actually own a company of myself, but to have the responsibility to be able to do things that matter. I see myself, today still, starting a company one day, but it's especially that mentality of wanting to be a part of something bigger that drives me to do what I do every day. I want to be a part of something that matters, that is innovative and above all, something I am responsible for.

            <p>
                I believe limiting one self is to block one to ever reach their full potential. Knowledge does not stop at any country borders. We live in a day and age where enormous amounts of knowledge is at our fingertips thanks to the internet. I regularly visit community websites and learning pages to see what peers with similar interest are up to and how I can improve myself. As stated above, working with people with similar interest towards a common goal is what creates opportunities to create truly worthwhile projects. It's also with the help of this community that I even applied and started with this formal education in the first place, and I'm very glad I did.

                The field of IT is embedded in all kinds of different sectors. It's unthinkable to not have a website or rely on software applications to run a business. This fact will allow me to meet and work with a lot of people. This education already has shed a light about how my future will unfold, and I can't wait to start working in IT.
