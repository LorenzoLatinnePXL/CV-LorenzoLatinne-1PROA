            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to My Portfolio!
            </p>
            <p>
            Hi, I’m Lorenzo Latinne, an aspiring software and web developer with a passion for learning and creating.
            I’m currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Programming and honing my skills in C#, JavaScript, HTML, and
            CSS. This portfolio serves as both a final project and a showcase of my growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you’ll find highlights of my work, including projects like a Mastermind game built in C# and this
                portfolio itself. Each project reflects my enthusiasm for blending logic and creativity—a hallmark of
                programming that I find deeply rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before diving into IT, I gained valuable experience as a Manager’s Assistant, where I sharpened my
                organizational and communication skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my wife and friends,
                playing guitar, and exploring the balance of discipline and creativity through music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for visiting—I’m excited to share my journey and future projects with you!
            </p>

            <h4>Why programming?</h4>
            <p class="emphasize1 bold">
                Why did I choose to study programming?
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to study programming because it opens doors to countless opportunities and empowers me to shape the digital world. It’s a highly in-demand skill with competitive salaries and the flexibility to work across industries or even start my own business. Programming sharpens my problem-solving skills and enables me to transform creative ideas into tangible solutions. I find it exciting to design and build tools that can make tasks easier or even innovate entirely new processes. The sense of accomplishment that comes from solving complex challenges and seeing my creations come to life is incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love that it’s a future-proof skill, keeping me relevant in a tech-driven world that’s constantly changing. The supportive community and wealth of accessible resources make learning both engaging and enjoyable. Programming also offers the chance to contribute to solving global challenges, whether through improving healthcare, advancing sustainability, or enhancing communication. It’s a field that encourages lifelong learning and personal growth, which inspires me to keep pushing my limits and exploring new possibilities.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasize1 bold">
                Why do I think this profession suits me?
            </p>
            <p>
                A profession in programming suits me well because I thrive on problem-solving and enjoy tackling challenges with a blend of logical thinking and creativity. The process of breaking down complex issues and devising efficient solutions is both stimulating and deeply satisfying for me. I’m passionate about technology and constantly curious about how systems operate, which aligns perfectly with the innovative and ever-evolving nature of programming. Exploring new tools and frameworks excites me, as it opens up endless opportunities to grow and refine my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flexibility to work remotely and maintain a healthy work-life balance makes this career even more appealing, offering the freedom to excel professionally while dedicating time to personal interests and relationships. This balance is crucial for sustaining motivation and long-term success. I also find great fulfillment in building practical solutions that address real-world needs, whether it’s simplifying tasks, enhancing productivity, or creating something entirely new. Seeing the tangible impact of my work not only inspires me but also reinforces my decision to pursue programming as more than just a career—it’s a meaningful and rewarding path that aligns with my values and aspirations.
