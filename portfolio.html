            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to My Portfolio!
            </p>
            <p>
            Hi, I’m Lorenzo Latinne, an aspiring software and web developer with a passion for learning and creating.
            I’m currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Programming and honing my skills in C#, JavaScript, HTML, and
            CSS. This portfolio serves as both a final project and a showcase of my growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you’ll find highlights of my work, including projects like a Mastermind game built in C# and this
                portfolio itself. Each project reflects my enthusiasm for blending logic and creativity—a hallmark of
                programming that I find deeply rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before diving into IT, I gained valuable experience as a Manager’s Assistant, where I sharpened my
                organizational and communication skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my wife and friends,
                playing guitar, and exploring the balance of discipline and creativity through music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for visiting—I’m excited to share my journey and future projects with you!
            </p>

            <h4>Why programming?</h4>
            <p class="emphasize1 bold">
                Why did I choose to study programming?
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to study programming because it opens doors to countless opportunities and empowers me to shape the digital world. It’s a highly in-demand skill with competitive salaries and the flexibility to work across industries or even start my own business. Programming sharpens my problem-solving skills and enables me to transform creative ideas into tangible solutions. I find it exciting to design and build tools that can make tasks easier or even innovate entirely new processes. The sense of accomplishment that comes from solving complex challenges and seeing my creations come to life is incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love that it’s a future-proof skill, keeping me relevant in a tech-driven world that’s constantly changing. The supportive community and wealth of accessible resources make learning both engaging and enjoyable. Programming also offers the chance to contribute to solving global challenges, whether through improving healthcare, advancing sustainability, or enhancing communication. It’s a field that encourages lifelong learning and personal growth, which inspires me to keep pushing my limits and exploring new possibilities.
            </p>
            <p class="emphasize1 bold">
                Why do I think this profession suits me?
            </p>
            <p>
                A profession in programming suits me well because I thrive on problem-solving and enjoy tackling challenges with a blend of logical thinking and creativity.

            </p>
            <p>
                The flexibility to work remotely and maintain a healthy work-life balance makes this career even more appealing, offering the freedom to excel professionally while dedicating time to personal interests and relationships. This balance is crucial for sustaining motivation and long-term success. I also find great fulfillment in building practical solutions that address real-world needs, whether it’s simplifying tasks, enhancing productivity, or creating something entirely new. Seeing the tangible impact of my work not only inspires me but also reinforces my decision to pursue programming as more than just a career—it’s a meaningful and rewarding path that aligns with my values and aspirations.

                        <span class="bold">Ideation and Conceptualisation: </span> I've created a plan for a personal website, as well as for a Mastermind game.

This branding is used to create a uniform experience in both pages. Fonts, colors, images and details are all meticulously chosen.

                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">1.</span> I've spent a fair amount of time, before the start of my formal education, self-learning programming. I've worked with a few data structures and logical algorithms. I also am able to apply set coding conventions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">2.</span> Since the start of this education, I've been learning how to program in C#. This is something that enables me to create more dynamic programs compared to the basic websites or console applications I used to program in the past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">3.</span> I still have a lot of time left to spent with C# to fully unlock my potential as a programmer. In addition to this I am also still left to be exposed to a whole array of frameworks and libraries that allow for more efficient code and therefore more scalable and useful projects.

                        <span class="bold">Coding and Development:</span> So far I've coded a CV website, a portfolio page and a Mastermind game. These projects required different tools and languages. I've managed to develop each project as its own entity, using code that's well-readable and adaptable when required.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Debugging and Troubleshooting:</span> As a programmer, it's unthinkable to develop software without running into certain bugs. It's a skill for a programmer to be able to identify these bugs and solve them correctly. I've encountered my fair share of bugs while developing my projects and I've learned to use the debugging and troubleshooting tools to be able to fix these issues.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Continuous Learning and Optimisation:</span> It never happens that a program of certain size is written overnight. When spending more time with a project, certain aspects are changed or rearranged. I've learned to refactor variables, methods and functions to make more sense within the program and allow for better readability. When new features are implemented, it's important that other parts of the program are adapted to allow for a better optimisation. For example, in the sprint-based project of the Mastermind game, it was important to implement these aspects.

                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">1.</span> During this formal education I've been given certain pieces of code with their own issues and errors. I was required to fix these bugs to get the program to do what it was expected to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">2.</span> I am able to detect certain bugs, some even by just looking at the code without running it yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="emphasize5 bold">3.</span> It's not easy to fix a certain bug and already be aware of any other bugs this fix can cause. Sometimes I might plan in more testing moments to prevent having to test "bigger" parts of a project at once.

                        <span class="bold">Test Execution:</span> No program ever gets released without testing. Better yet, it's important to test the project frequently so issues can be handled before they snowball into much bigger ones. I've learned to test my projects, both the web project as the C# project, to dodge further pitfalls and more work down the line.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Test Planning:</span> I've created a plan within my Mastermind Project at which stages of development I wish to test my program. Implementation of bigger features required more frequent testing.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Test Design:</span> I haven't yet created test designs but in the future I'm sure I will have to. These designs are meant to simulate real world scenarios in which the program has to be able to perform.

                        <span class="bold">Encouraging Collaboration:</span> I am a social being that enjoys working with a team or within a community aspiring to reach a common goal. I also like to motivate people to reach their full potential. This I also haven't done yet, but just like the example above, I will be doing this next semester.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Effective Meeting Management:</span> In my past work experience I was required to set up meetings and have these run smoothly. It's of great importance that most, if not all, bullet points are handled and a concise report is written. This allows for a better work flow and enables every member of the team to know what's expected of them.

                        <span class="bold">Pursuing Continuous Education:</span> I love to keep learning. I apply myself to online courses for programming so I always stay up-to-date with new trends. My first introduction with programming was finishing Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science. Since then I've done FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy and TheOdinProject. I still frequently browse through sites like Pluralsight and Udemy to find interesting courses.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">Practising Skills Regularly:</span> In my spare time I'm regularly coding, creating fun little projects or just honing my skills trying to reverse-engineer something someone else has created. The best way to get better in anything, is to do it consistently. That's the way I learned how to play guitar, sing, and how I learn to program.
