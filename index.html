<h2>
    Hello, world!
</h2>
<p>
    I’m Lorenzo Latinne, an aspiring software and web developer currently pursuing an associate degree in Programming. My journey into the world of IT began with a deep admiration for how technology shapes our lives and a desire to combine my passions with a fulfilling career. I’m on track to master C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I’m proud to be nearing the completion of Harvard’s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science—my first certification within the world of IT. This portfolio is a key part of my final project and an important step in my learning journey.
    Through my studies, I’ve tackled challenging problem sets and developed creative projects like a personal portfolio website and a Mastermind game built in C#. These experiences have strengthened my skills and fuelled my excitement for a future in programming, where the mix of logic and creativity is what intrigues me most.
    Prior to my studies, I worked for four years as a Manager’s Assistant, handling marketing, finances, and customer relations. This experience taught me the importance of communication and organization—skills I know will serve me well in the IT field.
    Outside of work, my greatest joy comes from spending time with my wife and close friends. I recently achieved one of my proudest milestones: buying a home with my wife as we prepare to welcome our first child at the end of 2024. In my free time, I love playing guitar, singing, and listening to music, finding inspiration in the balance between discipline and creativity.
    What motivates me most is the never-ending journey of learning. I love the challenge of tackling new ideas and solving problems in a field that truly interests me. IT offers the possibility of not only personal growth but also achieving a meaningful work-life balance—something I value deeply as I look forward to this exciting chapter in my life.
