    <h2>
        Hello, world!
    </h2>
    <p>
        I’m Lorenzo Latinne, an aspiring software and web developer currently pursuing an associate degree in Programming.
        My journey into the world of IT began with a deep admiration for how technology shapes our lives and a desire to
        combine my passions with a fulfilling career. I’m on track to master C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I’m proud to
        be nearing the completion of Harvard’s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science—my first certification within the
        world of IT. This portfolio is a key part of my final project and an important step in my learning journey.
        Through my studies, I’ve tackled challenging problem sets and developed creative projects like a personal portfolio
        website and a Mastermind game built in C#. These experiences have strengthened my skills and fuelled my excitement
        for a future in programming, where the mix of logic and creativity is what intrigues me most.
        Prior to my studies, I worked for four years as a Manager’s Assistant, handling marketing, finances, and customer
        relations. This experience taught me the importance of communication and organization—skills I know will serve me
        well in the IT field.
        Outside of work, my greatest joy comes from spending time with my wife and close friends. I recently achieved one of
        my proudest milestones: buying a home with my wife as we prepare to welcome our first child at the end of 2024. In
        my free time, I love playing guitar, singing, and listening to music, finding inspiration in the balance between
        discipline and creativity.
        What motivates me most is the never-ending journey of learning. I love the challenge of tackling new ideas and
        solving problems in a field that truly interests me. IT offers the possibility of not only personal growth but also
        achieving a meaningful work-life balance—something I value deeply as I look forward to this exciting chapter in my
        life.
